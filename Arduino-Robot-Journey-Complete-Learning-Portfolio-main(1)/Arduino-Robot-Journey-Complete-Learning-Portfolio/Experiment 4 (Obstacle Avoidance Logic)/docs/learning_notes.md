# Learning Notes - Experiment 04: Obstacle Avoidance Logic

## What I Learned

### 1. Decision Making Algorithms
- State machines for different behaviors
- Priority-based decision making
- Safe distance thresholds (10cm, 20cm, 30cm zones)

### 2. Sensor Fusion
- Combining ultrasonic and IR sensor data
- Weighted decision making
- Conflict resolution when sensors disagree

### 3. Emergency Protocols
- Immediate stop for close obstacles
- Gradual slowdown for distant obstacles
- Recovery procedures after obstacle cleared

## Real-World Applications
- Autonomous vehicle navigation
- Warehouse robots
- Smart wheelchair safety
- Drone collision avoidance

## Skills Developed
- Algorithm design
- Multi-sensor integration
- Safety system implementation
- State machine programming
