# Learning Notes - Experiment 06: Serial Motor Control

## What I Learned

### 1. Serial Communication Protocol
- UART communication at 9600 baud
- ASCII character command parsing
- Command validation and error handling

### 2. Remote Control Systems
- Computer-to-robot communication
- Real-time command execution
- Feedback and status reporting

### 3. Command Set Design
- Simple mnemonic commands (F=Forward, B=Backward)
- Parameter passing (S150 = Speed 150)
- Safety interlocks

## Practical Applications
- Remote-controlled robots
- Industrial equipment remote operation
- Testing and debugging interface
- Educational tool for learning

## Skills Developed
- Serial protocol implementation
- Command parsing algorithms
- User interface design (command line)
- Debugging via serial monitor
