# Learning Notes - Experiment 05: Line Follower Logic

## What I Learned

### 1. Multi-Sensor Arrays
- 3-sensor configuration (Left, Center, Right)
- Weighted decisions based on sensor pattern
- Edge detection and recovery

### 2. Control Algorithms
- Basic: ON/OFF (bang-bang) control
- Advanced: PID control basics
- Speed adjustment on curves

### 3. Error Handling
- Lost line recovery procedures
- Intersection detection
- Sharp turn management

## Key Insights
- Sensor spacing affects detection accuracy
- Speed affects stability (slower = more stable)
- Line thickness matters for reliable detection
- Surface contrast is critical

## Applications
- Factory AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles)
- Educational robotics competitions
- Hospital delivery robots
- Automated warehouse systems
