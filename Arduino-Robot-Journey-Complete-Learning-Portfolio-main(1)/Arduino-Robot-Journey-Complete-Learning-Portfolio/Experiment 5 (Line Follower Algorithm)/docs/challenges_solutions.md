# Challenges & Solutions - Experiment 05

## Challenge 1: Wobbling/Wandering
**Problem:** Robot oscillates around line
**Solution:** Reduce speed, adjust sensor thresholds, implement PID

## Challenge 2: Missing Sharp Turns
**Problem:** Robot loses line on sharp corners
**Solution:** Wider sensor array, predictive turning, slower speed on curves

## Challenge 3: Different Surface Reflection
**Problem:** Works on test track, fails on different surface
**Solution:** Auto-calibration routine, adaptive thresholds

## Challenge 4: Intersection Confusion
**Problem:** Doesn't know which way to turn at intersections
**Solution:** Memorize path, use additional sensors, pre-programmed routes

## Challenge 5: Light Sensitivity
**Problem:** Different lighting changes sensor readings
**Solution:** Shield sensors, use consistent lighting, dynamic calibration
