# Learning Notes - Experiment 01

## What I Learned

### 1. How Ultrasonic Sensors Work
- HC-SR04 sends sound waves and measures echo time
- Distance = (time × speed of sound) ÷ 2
- Speed of sound = 0.034 cm per microsecond

### 2. Arduino Programming
- Using `digitalWrite()` to control pins
- `pulseIn()` function measures time
- Serial Monitor for debugging

### 3. Circuit Design
- LEDs need current-limiting resistors
- 220Ω resistors work for all colors
- Color coding wires helps troubleshooting

## Skills I Developed
1. Reading sensor datasheets
2. Calculating resistor values
3. Debugging with Serial Monitor
4. Organizing code with functions

## Real-World Applications
- Car parking sensors
- Robot obstacle detection
- Industrial safety systems
- Smart home devices
