## Our Workflow : How We Work Together


Hardware Setup : Both Contribute

Sensor Integration : Both Contribute

Algorithm Development : Both Contribute

Documentation of every experiment : Esha Purakayastha

Schematics of Every Experiment : Debarghya Samanta



## Development Process (For Code / Hardware - Both)


When working on shared features : 

Step 1 : Discuss first, agree on approach

Step 2 : One creates branch 

Step 3 : Work together or divide tasks

Step 4 : Regular commits with clear messages

Step 5 : Both Review before PR

Step 6 : Merge after annual approval



## Documentation Process


After hardware/feature completion :
Esha Purakayastha creates documentation branch

# Esha Purakayastha writes README files with :

1. Instructions from our testing
  
2. Code Explanations
   
3. Learning outcomes

# Debarghya Samanta provides :

1. Clean schematics (TinkerCad / Photos)

2. Clean component specifications

3. Wiring validation



## Schematic Process


After circuit is working : 
Debarghya Samanta creates schematic branch

### Debarghya Samanta Creates/updates  :

1. TinkerCad files

2. Clean circuit diagrams

3. Connections tables

### Esha Purakayastha provides :

1. Clear descriptions for the diagrams

2. Integration with documentation

3. GitHub organization


Both review, then merge.



##  Communication Plan that works for us :


1. Progress Review : What documentation completed?, What schematics completed?, What hardware/ code completed?

2. Plan Next Week : Divide upcomming tasks, set realistic deadlines, identify challenges,

3. GitHub Review : Check open PRs, review merged work, Update this CONTRIBUTING.md file if needed.



## Credit sharing :


In presentations : We built together, Debarghya Samanta led schematics, Esha Purakayastha led documentation.

On GitHub : Both listed as contributors.

In reports : Clear sections showing who did what.



## How we updated this document?


1. Esha Purakayastha proposes changes to the file.

2. Debarghya Samanta reviews and suggests edits.

3. Both agree on the final version.

4. Both follow the rules.



*Our Partnership Philosophy* :

"We combine hardware hands-on work with professional documentation to create something greater than either could do alone."
