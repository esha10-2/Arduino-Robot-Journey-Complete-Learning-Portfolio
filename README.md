# Arduino-Robot-Journey-Complete-Learning-Portfolio
This repository documents my journey in building my first autonomous Arduino line following robot with obstacle detecting abilities starting with 6 foundational experiments consisting of smart distance alert, IR line detection, motor control, obstacle avoidance logic, line-follower algorithm, and serial communication to the final autonomous robot.
Timeline : December 2025 - January 2026
